# Solid Snake

## Description

Solid Snake is a classic C implementation of the snake game, inspired by this [ASMR programming video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUJE10XEjrU).

The game features a growing snake that consumes apples while avoiding collisions with itself.

## Objectives

- Developed an enjoyable implementation of the classic Snake game in C, playable in a Terminal.
- Implemented core game mechanics, including:
    - Snake movement.
    - Apple generation.
    - Snake growth upon eating an apple.
    - Collision detection.
    - Scoring system.
- Ensured the code adhered to the Betty coding standard for improved readability and consistency.
- Demonstrated and confirmed proficiency in C programming through this project.
